  desc: >
    This package contains two functions to show what is possible when
    building your own \code{R} package and creating your own website using
    \code{pkgdown}. The function listed below is *exported*, which means it can
    easily be called after you have installed and loaded the package. The other
    function is an error handling function that is *not* exported. You can call
    it like so: \code{learnerpkg:::handleError_subject}.
